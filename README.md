# NaiveSentimentAnalysis

This an exampe of a naive approach to sentiment analysis (if you can call it that way) in Spanish.
I basically gathered a table with positive and negative words and evaluated the occurrence of them in a collected database of tweets.

I've been looking for a more suitable corpus for Spanish sentiment analysis, but haven't found it yet.
